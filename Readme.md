ETHLinked is a decentralized app(DApp) that lets you put all of your achievement on blockchain. With ETHLinked you can now post all of your achievemnts on ethereum network with the guarantee that your data will never change and it will not be owned by any central authority. To use ETHLinked you need to install metamask and then connect to the ropsten testnet. You can add title, description(350 words), tag(15 words) for a particular achievement. Comment feature is currenlty disabled but will soon be available where others users can comment on your achievement. It also supports dark mode and light mode depending on system default settings.
